# MLGamePred
ML project that predicts the outcome of sporting events
Thi project will use classifacation to predict either win/loss based on differnt predictors
## Project Goals
- Create training and test data sets from prior game data and player stats on baseball reference and baseball sevant
- fine tune machine learning algorithm
- test differnt machine learning algoritems on data to find which has the best accuracy.
## Plan of Action
### Step 1 - Creating Data sets
- Figure out key perecictors for game outcomes.
- Get data. Figure out where data should come from.
- Clean data
- Create Visualizations of data
